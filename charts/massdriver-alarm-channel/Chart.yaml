name: massdriver-alarm-channel
description: Implements Massdriver's "alarm channel" concept by using the Prometheus Operator's [AlertmanagerConfig](https://prometheus-operator.dev/docs/operator/design/#alertmanagerconfig) to create a new route in AlertManager's routing tree for sending all alarms with the proper label (`md_package=<massdriver package name>`) to the proper package-scoped Massdriver webhook.

# A chart can be either an 'application' or a 'library' chart.
#
# Application charts are a collection of templates that can be packaged into versioned archives
# to be deployed.
#
# Library charts provide useful utilities or functions for the chart developer. They're included as
# a dependency of application charts to inject those utilities and functions into the rendering
# pipeline. Library charts do not define any templates and therefore cannot be deployed.
type: application

# This is the chart version. This version number should be incremented each time you make changes
# to the chart and its templates, including the app version.
# Versions are expected to follow Semantic Versioning (https://semver.org/)
version: 0.0.1
